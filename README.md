<h2>Introduction to Web Design Project</h2>
Welcome to my first website project which I've created by scratch as a part of the course I am taking called "Introduction to Web Design". This project marks my initial milestone in to my journey toward becoming a UX designer. 
<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<b>Description:</b> This project serves as a demonstration of my knowledge of employing the assembly languages HTML and CSS as a means of developing and designing a live website. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Purpose:</b> Overall, I aim to apply the fundamental principles I learn in my course and solidify my knowledge through practice. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Future Enhancements:</b>
<ul>
  <li><i>Interactive Elements:</i></li> I want to incorporate elements that users can interact with such as buttons and animations.
  <li><i>Accessibility:</i></li> To assure accessibility for diverse users, I want to research and employ additional features.
  <li><i></i>Responsive Design:</i></li> Considering that users may access my site from either a web browser or a mobile device, I want to assure that the pages have correct and adaptable layouts.
</ul>

Thank you for checking out my project!
